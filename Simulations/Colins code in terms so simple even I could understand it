Colins code in terms so simple even I could understand it :) 

DECLARE STATES

DECLARE VARIABLES
    cc = current colour
    ccPrev = last current colour
    prevCol = 
    
    
setup()
    state = state0
    prevCol = black
    ccPrev = black
    
draw()
    
    cc = get colour function
    
    //START OF STATE MACHINE
    state machine()
    
        when state0()
            if cc = red and ccPrev = black //if goes onto red line
                state = state1
                ccPrev = red
            if cc = green and ccPrev = black //if goes onto green line
                state = state3
                ccPrev = green
                
        when state1() //on red line
            if cc = black and ccPrev = red //goes to black from red
                state = state2
                
        when state2() //leaving red line add one to count
            ccPrev = black
            state = state0
            count++
